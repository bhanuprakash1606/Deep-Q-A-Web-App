# Deep Learning Q&A App using Anvil, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and `roberta-base-squad2`

Welcome to **DeepQA**, an interactive Question & Answer (Q&A) application powered by deep learning! This app is built using Anvil, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and the `roberta-base-squad2` model. With DeepQA, you can ask questions and receive relevant answers based on a given context.

## Features

- **Ask and Answer**: DeepQA allows you to input a context (paragraph, article, etc.) and ask questions related to the context. The app then uses the power of `roberta-base-squad2` to provide accurate and context-aware answers.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Anvil platform offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the app. Simply input your context and question, and the app takes care of the rest.

- **Quick and Accurate Responses**: Leveraging the capabilities of the Hugging Face Transformers library and the `roberta-base-squad2` model, DeepQA delivers quick and accurate responses to your questions.

## Getting Started
